### Theory Basic

* **IC Package** - the material that contains a semiconductor device. The package is a case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from corrosion or physical damage and allow mounting of the electrical contacts connecting it to the printed circuit board (PCB).

* **Pad** - a square of top-level metal of approximately 100Âµm on a side that is either soldered to bond wire connecting to a package or coated with lead solder ball. Pad refers to metal square only or to the complete I/O cell containing the metal.
* **Core** - a core comprises a logical execution unit and functional units. It able to independently execute programs or threads. Consists of main logics.
* **Die** - is the formal term for the square of silicon containing an integrated circuit that has been cut out of the wafer.

**Macro and Foundry IP's**

![note1day0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/203972752-ff83fa9e-0606-4701-8380-ad3f4b81ec4c.jpg)

* **Macro** - Hard macro, firm macro and soft macro are all known as IP (Intellectual property). They are optimized for power, area and performance. They can be purchased and used in your ASIC or FPGA design implementation flow. Soft macro is flexible for all type of ASIC implementation. Soft macros are synthesizable register transfer level (RTL) design forms, have more flexibility, and can be configured compared to hard complex macros. Using Soft macros in the design is a risk factor because of its being unpredictable behavior in timing, performance and power
* **Foundry IP's** - all Intellectual Property, regardless of when or for what purpose it is developed, pertaining to genetic components, pathways, and strains; and methods and tools for design, genetic engineering, testing and/or small-scale fermentation of microbial strains.Has higher value compared to macro.

**Software communication with Hardware**

<img width="547" alt="process flow" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205565519-1869689f-7d35-4ccf-bdd7-a38275e7a8f7.png">

**Synthesis process** - a process of converting RTL (synthesizable Verilog code) into a technology specific Gate level netlist which includes nets, sequential cells, combinational cells and their connectivity. It is a process of combining pre-existing elements to form something new. It is the conversion of an idea into an implementation.

**Process flow**:

**Application Software** -> **System Software** -> **Hardware**

**Specification/instructions** - written in RTL (high-level language) such as C, C++ or Java as inputs.
**Compiler** - compile of the instruction into assembly language (.exe).
**Assembler** - convert of the assembly language into gate level language (low-level language or machine language) which is in binary format, and it is the language understood by a computer.

## Day 1

### Open-source Simulator Iverilog and Synthesis

![TestBench](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205607323-ed0d9f04-64bf-44ef-815b-015f60d2d878.jpg)

**Simulator** - Tool used to simulating design. RTL design checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design. eg: iverilog.
**Design** - The actual Verilog code / set of Verilog codes. It has intended functionality to meet the requirements. 
**TestBench** - A setup to check the functionality of the design wether it is obeying or not by applying stimulus(test_vesctors).
 Note: Simualtor is looking for change in the input values. No change in input, no change to the output. 
 
 **Iverilog Simultion Flow**:
 
 ![iverilog flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205609796-a0640932-c666-427b-bd1d-580b11ca72be.jpg)

 **VCD file** - Value Change Dump format file, output file of iverilog. 
 **gtkwave** - A tool to view the output in a waveform format.

![yosys 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205850578-acdc3325-bfdc-46f4-bb25-2dde63261765.jpg)

**Synthesizer** - tool used to convert RTL to netlist. Eg: Yosys.
**Netlist** - a file of representative of the design in  the form of standard cells in the .lib .

Verify the Synthesis :

Synthesis 

![synthesis 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205862428-d27fdb4b-5a18-425c-9500-c17456091855.jpg)

**RTL Design** - Behavioral representation of the required specification. 
**Synthesis** - The RTL to gate level translation where the design is converted into gates and the connections are made between gates which given out as a file called netlist.
**.lib** - Collection of logical modules includes basic logic gates. Different flavors of same gate. 

Combinational delay in logic path determines the max speed of operation of digital logic circuit. We need cells to work fast enough for required performance.
Faster the charging , lesser the cell delay. Propagation delay is the time for the input to be fill up the output.

![sysnthesis 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118954022/205865780-da755d6c-7a6b-4fbf-b6c3-6cdc002bbca5.jpg)

We need cells to work fast enough for required performance.Faster the charging/discharging of capacitance, lesser the cell delay. Propagation delay is the time for the input to be fill up the output. Faster cells do not comes free, they comes with area and power consumption. 

Why do we need slow cells? - to meet holds. To ensure that there are no HOLD issues at DFF_B, we need cells that work slowly.
The collection forms the **.lib** .

**Transistors** - charge/discharge the capacitance fast and sourcing more current. **Wider transistors** - low delay (more area and power). **Narrow transistors** - More delay (less area and power). 
**Constarints** - the guidance offered to syntheziser with the correct set of cells.
